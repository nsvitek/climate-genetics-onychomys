R script map: Onychomys leugocaster analyses

########################
### Pre-Analysis     ###
### Process GIS data ###
	
GIS_10-year-mean-phenology_make.R [takes the 10 yr average of eMODIS data, only needs to be done once after data are downloaded]

GIS_base.R [makes oleu_environemnt.csv, the environmental/geographic data] 
	|_ GIS_specimens_oleu.R [makes cleaned coordinates for specimens]
	|_ GIS_map-load.R 	[loads all of the raster environment maps for each variable: eats memory: do this part on a powerful computer]

### Process genetic data ###
oleu_base_cluster.R [read in metadata]
	|_ oleu_gen.R [read in x, the raw genetic SNP data]
		|_oleu_gen_fst.R [writes pairwise Fst tables at (A) genetic group and (B) populations levels for each level of missing data, plus global Fst stats
		|_oleu_gen_none_missing.R [writes "snps.missing.interpolated.csv" for each level of missing data]

########################
### Analysis		 ###

	|- MMRR.R [dependency]
	|- oleu_pst_fst_functions.R [dependency]
oleu_base.R [read in metadata, genetic data]
	|_ oleu_phenotype.R [makes shapes, also ran error]
		|_ oleu_linear error.R 
		|_ oleu_error.R
	|_ oleu_map.R	[makes Fig of map, Table  of specimen sample size]
	|_ oleu_environment.R [make env.block, PCA.environment, PCA.phenotype]
		|_ oleu_PCA_non_gen.R [reporting of PCA figs, data]
	| [standardize blocks and block names]
--------- [will need to repeat this for phenotype options]
		|_ oleu_disparity.R
--------- [will need to repeat this for levels of mdat] 
			|_ oleu_PCA_gen.R [genetic PCA, figure]
			|_ oleu_PLS.R [2B-PLS: using snps vs. scaled environment vs. 2 versions of phenotype
			|_ oleu_distances.R [MMRR and scaling]
				|_ oleu_visualize_pops.R [optional, just for figuring predicted shapes]
			|_ oleu_pst_fst.R [PST/FST comparisons]
	
	
###### temporary planning #########
As of deciding on a phenotypic block, 
write each block as a csv file.
Also write each PCA.genotype block as a csv file.
put into the folder structure
upload the folder structure to the cluster
then create a cluster_base.R file that reads in the csvs, settings, dependencies for cluster
and run the 10 versions of all the analyses on the cluster

Mono: 2x fossil story, fish: pupfish, Owen's Valley, troug: Walker, Pyramid Lake. No precise chronology for spillage/connections

when the lake spills over, carve spillover channel, but very short. wettest: last glaciation: abruptly gastropods.
